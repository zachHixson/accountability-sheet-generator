## About

This is a simple tool I made to help a coworker. It simply sorts and fills a table with names in a way that's friendly to printing.

## How to download

- Click `Clone or Download` and `Download ZIP`
- Go to your downloads folder (`Start > File explorer > Downloads` or wherever you saved it to)
- Right click on `accountability-sheet-generator-master.zip` and click `Extract All` then click `Extract`
    - you can now delete the .zip file if you want to
- Open the folder and run `accountability_table_generator.html`

## How to use
- **Title:** Changes the title at the top of the sheet
- **Name List:** Paste or enter all names that will be added to the accountability sheet
    - Each name should be on it's own line
- **Rows / Cols**: The ammount of rows and columns the final table will have
    - Rows **x** Columns must be equal to or greater than the amount of names entered.

After the table is generated you can edit or print.

**NOTE:** The table might look different on your screen than it will on the paper. If you are using Chrome, it will show you an accurate preview when you click the `Print` button.
- If using another internet browser than Chrome, it is recomended that you print to `.PDF` first to get an accurate preview, and then print.
